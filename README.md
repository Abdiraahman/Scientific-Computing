# Scientific-Computing

   OBJECTIVES OF THE SCRIPTS
    
   1.datatypes.py
   
Defining variables of different data types in Python.

Printing the data type of each variable.

Performing type conversions.

   2.Control_structures.py
   
Checks if a user-provided integer is even or odd.

Prints all even numbers between 1 and 50 using a for loop.

Prints numbers from 10 down to 1 in reverse order using a while loop.
  
   3.modular_functions.py
   
This script calculates the area of different shapes using a function that takes shape type and dimensions as input.

   4.numpy_basics.py

How to create and display a two-dimensional array using the NumPy library

   HOW TO RUN THE SCRIPTS
   
Install Python  3.

Copy the script into a Python file, such as data_types.py

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the script's directory.

Run the script using the command: python script_name example python data_types.py
